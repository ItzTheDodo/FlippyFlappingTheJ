# FlippyFlappingTheJ

FlippyFlappingTheJ is an open-source WIP JFlap alternative in Python that is cross-platform compatible. It is designed to help researchers and students in automata theory.
FlippyFlappingTheJ currently only supports Non-Deterministic finite automata (NDFA), Deterministic finite automata (DFA), and combinational logic; however, there are plans to expand to pushdown automata, Turing machines, and to implement the pumping lemma. The software uses Thompson's construction to generate automata from regular expressions, and it has 2 types of input files: language and automaton files, for representing outputs of the software.
